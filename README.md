Now'What is Neat?
NEAT is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley for evolving arbitrary neural networks. NEAT-Python is a pure Python implementation of NEAT, with no dependencies other than the Python standard library. Currently this library supports Python versions 3.6 through 3.11, as well as PyPy 3.
